          To use this Google Assistant action you must first install and configure the
          <a href="https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-gsh">homebridge-gsh</a>
          plugin in your local Homebridge instance.
        </p>

          You are seeing this page because your instance is not currently connected to the Homebridge GSH servers.

          If you have already configured the <a href="https://github.com/oznu/homebridge-gsh">homebridge-gsh</a> plugin,
